		<h1>Web 2 - Project 1 Planning Document</h1>
			<p>Use this template to help you track your website building process. You should turn this root folder in with your final Portage Trail Outfitter site.</p>
		
		<h2>Client Meeting Summary</h2>
		<h3>Client Goals:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Rent out gear</li>
				<li>Modernize (by creating an internet presence)</li>
				<li>Keep the 'mom &amp; pop' feeling.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Local business links</p>
			<p>Add weather data</p>
			
			<p>Keep most of the content as-is, unless for a very speific reason, or the content is changed for the better.</p>
			
			<p>Make the feeling of the website feel <i>Nostalgic, Rustic, and Natural.</i></p>
			<p>More of a spring season feel rather than an autumn feel.</p>
			
			<p>There is too much content for one page, so make sure to organize it and put it on the right pages.</p>
			
			<p>We have free reign over the colors, the logo, and the design as a whole.</p>
			
			<p>Remember to showcase the cabins that are available, but do not include online booking (because there is none).</p>
		
		<h2>Target Market</h2>
			<p>Groups // Group Leaders // Couples' Retreats</p>
			<p>School groups, kids groups, church groups, and more specifically the leaders of each group.</p>
			<p>Focusing on 7-person groups.</p>
		
		<h2>Project Objective</h2>
			<p>I want the site to feel modern, with a rustic theme composed of natural colors.</p>
		
		<h2>Competitor Analysis and Research</h2>
			<p>What do they do well? What areas do they lack and give you the opportunity to capitalize on? </p>
			<p><b>http://www.natureadventureoutfitters.com/</b></p>
			<p>This site lets you know a lot of information, but their presentation is not very good. The site is mainly just text with no style, and it's very hard and boring to read. Also, all of their images are very low quality.</p>
			<p>I think we can improve the feeling of Portage Trail's website by including high-quality images and well-structured content that looks and feels good.</p>
		
		<h2>Color and Design References</h2>
			<p>replace this text with screenshots of anything inspirational to help you in the design process - color - type - texture - anything.</p>
		
		<h2>Sitemap</h2>
			<p>replace this text with a screenshot of your sitemap outlining site structure and information flow.</p>
		
		<h2>Thumbnails </h2>
			<p>replace this text with scans of your thumbnails. Whatever you have for developmental sketches should be shown here.  Employers like to see "behind-the-scenes" and view how you come up with  ideas.</p>
		
		<h2>Detailed sketches </h2>
			<p>replace this text with scans of your three detailed sketches showing three different design solutions (mobile and desktop). These should be detailed drawings that communicate to a non-designer, non-visual person, just what the site will look like.</p>
		
		<h2>Design Comps</h2>
			<p>replace this text with screenshots or .jpgs of the .psds for two of your best designs. Show mobile and desktop for both.</p>
		
		<h2>Final Design Comp</h2>
			<p>replace this text with a screenshot or jpg of your final design comp. Show both mobile and desktop.</p>
		
		<h2>Links to the images used</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>replace this list</li>
				<li>with the links</li>
				<li>to the images you used</li>
				<li>in your design. If they are</li>
				<li>yours just say so</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2>Reflection: Summary of Concept and Solution</h2>
			<p>Describe how your design achieves the design rationale above. Add any other information you gather, or anything else you'd like to highlight or remember about making this website. This should  be your longest paragraph.  Describe what you want a viewer to feel when visiting your site and what design decisions you made to create that “feel.” How  are you visually communicating your client&rsquo;s message to  their customers?. </p>
			<p>Tell your story. </p>
			<p>What do you want the customers to  think of when they interact with your design work? Did you wait under an umbrella for hours to get just the right photo of  their sidewalk bistro filled with happy customers? Did you draw upon the  surrounding historical buildings for the logo art, design elements, and  background photos? tell your story and inject personality into your  description.</p>
